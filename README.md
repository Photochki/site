You can either build project with file system or host it on server using 

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to build project to file system again, there might be some problems basePath and assetPrefix in next.config.mjs

```
npm run build
```
